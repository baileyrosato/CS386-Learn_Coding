## 1. System Description
The problem of accessing the world of computer programming affects the general population of learners, the impact of which is limiting their access to the modern world.

Unlike CodeHS, our product allows users to work in groups and is available to everyone. CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web- application designed to teach coding to all ages at any level of coding experience.
