## 1. System Description
The problem of accessing the world of computer programming affects the general population of learners, the impact of which is limiting their access to the modern world. For anyone interested in learning about coding, CodeHub is a free education application that lets you learn the basics of computer literacy and programming at your own pace. Unlike CodeHS, our product allows users to work in groups and is available to everyone. CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web- application designed to teach coding to all ages at any level of coding experience. 

Users sign in using an email and password. If they hold a <u>moderator</u> role, they sign in and are granted specific moderator privileges. All users are directed to their profile and can update their settings to customize their profile picture, screen name, display, update privacy settings, and set their preferred notification type and frequency. Notifications are displayed on the userâ€™s homepage. The user can also view their achievements on their profile page.  

On their homepage, users can track their progress, check updates, and participate in chats. Users can access their groups from the homepage and can join or leave groups using a group ID. The moderator can create or remove groups and group members as well as oversee activities. Once in a group, users can send and receive messages in that specific group chat and the moderator can monitor chats. The homepage also displays the users' rankings and their unit courses. This includes the next activities they must complete and any related videos. Users can view their progress in a unit course. How well they progress in their unit course(s) determines their rank. Users can get help in a community forum by asking questions and responding to other users. Moderators manage the forum and provide quality feedback.
