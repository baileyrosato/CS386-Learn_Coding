# Project Inception 

_Team 7: CodeHub\
Febuary 4th, 2022\
Writers: Ricardo Chairez, Ian Dennis, Kelene Moore, Bailey Rosato, Nasya Valenzuela, Nicole Sylvester

## 1. Introduction
For those who are curious, want a hobby, or interested in beginning a career, CodeHub is a web application designed to provide a fundamental programming education without a rigorous schedule or class fees. Users learn in a multitude of ways. They can choose to take on real, open ended, coding projects to test their knowledge. Or they can follow along with guided exercises to learn basic concepts. Along the way, users will also be able to compare their learning to others with achievements and rankings. Users who already know a language will also be able to learn coding by drawing parallels from what they already know.

Future work may include integration into school districts, focusing on elementary and junior high schools, where there is less accessibility for a computer science education. Being able to add a teacher persona to the application that allows them to monitor student’s progress and assist them, as necessary. Another future goal is to include large scale programming projects that will require users to carefully plan their work, and even work in teams.

Consumer Segments: Teacher/School district, Early education_

**Sumary of Interview:** 
Technology Integration Educator. 50 years old, has Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Secondary Education. From an educator standpoint, moving away from applications that focus solely on drag-and-drop coding is desired. Self-sufficient learning is important. The independence of the application could make it a must have for K-8 education.

- Visuals are not a top priority - teachers are more concerned with content

**Relevent Quotes**
- “Parents won’t want their kids to be able to talk to anyone on a community hub - it’s a safety concern”
- “Colors are not the most important thing, but using colors for learning association would be beneficial”

**Consumer Assessment (Must have/Nice to have/Don't care)**
- Must have - Achievements and awards system
- Nice to have - Regular coding reminders
- Don’t care - Community discussion/forum

The idea of project based learning is a good one. According to the customer the best learning is done by jumping in headfirst
and trying to accomplish something. Additionally having as many learning methods available as possible is critical. As is making
the content accessible to people who are not in an educational environment and have little to no prior formal education.

**Key Insights**
- Include projects, data analysis projects would be great. As would anything that could apply towards 3D modelling.

- Outside features (reminders, chats, achievements/rankings, etc.) should all be included because they encourage some people. They should have an option to turn them off however.

**Relevent Quotes**
- "The earlier people are exposed to technologies the better."
- "In the past, wathing a video for basic concepts, reading manuels for reference, and a hands on project for actually learning and remembering the concepts is how I've learned best."

Interviewee: Mary Dennis\
Date of Interview: 2/4/2022\
Consumer Segments: Employee Traning, Teacher_

**Sumary of Interview:**
Customer has no code experience and hates working with computers. However, having an app that teaches coding and computer literacy would be extremely helpful for work where a lot of the software is out of date and unintuitive. Working from the very basics up with plenty of video examples would be key.

**Key Insights**
- Include a lot of video walthroughs. No more that 15 minutes per video.
- Include a branch out tab that shows similiar things to what the user is doing (i.e. how the objects you're using in Java might apply in C#). This could replace learning languages in parallel.
- Clear layout and defined buttons + optional navigation tutorial
- Allow people to achieve a "mentor" role if they progress far enough in a course

**Relevent Quotes**
- "I personally would only be motivated by projects that are inately motivating. Doing an in depth coding project that doesn't benefit me in the future would seem like a waste of time to me."
- "The layout should start very descriptive. User's who don't want every button and action labelled can have the option to turn it off."

**Consumer Assessment (Must have/Nice to have/Don't care)**
- Video tutorials: Must have
- Descriptive layout: Must have
- Secure/virus free: Must have
- Community hub, forums, and peer assistance: Nice to have
- Rankings, reminders, and achievements: Don't care
- Projects: Don't care
