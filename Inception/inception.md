**Sumary of Interview:**
The interviewee had a lot of information and suggestions. Discussed this app being used by companies training their employees. Also discussed having live chats, a simple IDE to start off, and then a more advanced IDE like Eclipse once you gain more coding experience.

**Key Insights**
- An IDE such as Eclipse where you can debug, and it also shows the output right away
- Compete against other people and earn points
- Start with the basic like learning languages, then work up to things like web and app development

**Relevent Quotes**
- “At work people go to training so it would be cool if they could do it through a website or app like this.”
- On learning multiple languages in parallel: “It helps you understand the languages better because you can see the differences and why one way may be better for that particular circumstance, but the languages would have to be kind of similar.”
- “Unlocking built in functions after you write them yourself”
- “Have coding teams, work with other people, challenges with your friends”

**Consumer Assessment (Must have/Nice to have/Don't care)**
- Regular coding reminders: Nice to have
- Learning multiple languages in parallel: Nice to have
- Achievements and rewards systems: Nice to have
- Community hub, or ranking system: Must have (somewhere to ask questions)
